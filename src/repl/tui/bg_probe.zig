//! 启动期终端探测:一轮往返问清背景色(OSC 11)与 Kitty 键盘协议(`CSI ? u`),DA1 作哨兵(#327)。
//!
//! 机制:进 raw(保留已到的输入)→ 一次写出 `[OSC 11 ?][CSI ? u] CSI c` → 读应答直到 DA1
//! 回来或超时 → 还原 termios。每个终端都答 DA1(primary device attributes),而终端按顺序应答:
//! DA1 到了还没见到 Kitty 应答,就是确定的"不支持",不用等超时;OSC 11 同理。超时(~120ms)
//! 只是兜底——应答在路上太久(慢 SSH)或终端什么都不答,结果是"不知道",调用方沿用旧默认;
//! 迟到的应答由 `Late` 接着读掉(终端保持安静,不回显),直到 REPL 接管。
//! 查询发出前已经排在队列里的应答(上一个程序没读走的)不算这一轮的。
//! 背景色:`\x1b]11;rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB\x07`(或 ST `\x1b\\` 结尾)→ 解析高字节 → BT.601 亮度判明暗。
//!
//! 同一批字节里不是应答的(探测期间敲的键、粘贴的文字)原样交还 stdin
//! (platform.terminal.replayInput):输入 parser 照常读到它们,应答本身不会被当成按键。
//!
//! 谨慎:① 只在交互 tty 启动期调一次;② 超时短不拖慢启动;③ 还原 termios;
//! ④ 管道/NO_PROBE/非 tty 由调用方跳过(本模块也自带非 tty 守卫)。
