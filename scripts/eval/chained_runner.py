"""Chained-attempt native E2E runner: K sequential attempts per task on one
carried TinyKG store, two arms, order-balanced.

`run-paired` runs independent rollouts: every attempt starts with a fresh
fake HOME and an empty store, so it cannot measure whether what one attempt
leaves in memory helps the next one. A *chain* here is K sequential attempts
at one task, in one arm, for one replicate. Attempt 1 starts with an empty
store; after every attempt the runner exports the scenario's TinyKG store
(`<workspace>/.home/.metacodes/kg/store.kg[.v2]`) to a tar it owns, and the
next attempt of the same chain imports exactly that tar before its session
starts (`tests/e2e/lib.sh` `import_kg_store`). Every attempt runs with
`METACODES_TASK_HINT` = the task id and `METACODES_KG_DOMAIN` = the task's
chain domain (`chain_kg_domain`): the binary's default domain is derived from
the workspace's git root, which is a new run directory every attempt, and
project-scoped memory - lessons included - is recalled only from the
session's own domain and `global`. Nothing else carries over: the workspace
is the task's frozen snapshot again, and no store crosses chains, replicates
or arms.

Provenance is a hash-chained ledger per arm (`<chain-dir>/<arm>/ledger.jsonl`,
schema `metacodes-chain-ledger-v1`): one row per attempt with the sha256 of
the store it imported (null for attempt 1) and of the store it exported.
Attempt k's import must equal attempt k-1's export, every tar must still
hash to its row, `lib.sh` must have written an import witness with the same
hash (and none for attempt 1), and the ledger and the rollout checkpoint must
name the same attempts. Any break fails closed before another paid rollout:
a forked or silently reset memory would void the comparison.

Spend goes through the durable budget journal (`memory_budget_journal`), as
in every other paid runner: each attempt is reserved against the journal's
authority (the cumulative caps less the prior-spend offsets) at its full
per-rollout allowance, authorized before the session starts and committed
with its measured usage. From authorization on, an attempt is a paid attempt
whatever happens next. If anything after that point fails (the session, the
import witness, the store export, the evidence import, the commit), the
runner appends a `failed` ledger row and the journal keeps the transaction
authorized, so its whole allowance stays charged; resume refuses the chain
instead of running the attempt again. A runner killed before it can write
that row leaves the authorized transaction alone, which resume refuses the
same way.

Rollouts are the ordinary scored rows of `run-paired`, keyed by
`trial = replicate * attempts + (attempt - 1)`, so `cli.py compare` pairs
attempt k of replicate r across arms. The store is exported before the
rollout is imported, so the offline grade (the task's success check, which
`import_run` runs on the final workspace) can never reach the store or any
prompt.
