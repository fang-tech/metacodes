"""TinyKG services (`metacodes --state-dir <root> kgd`) a test left running.

A CLI session that needs TinyKG starts its install's service in its own state
root, and the service outlives the session on purpose: it does not exit when
idle (src/app/kg_autostart.zig). A test that runs the real binary in a
throwaway HOME therefore leaves one service behind per run, unless it sets
`METACODES_KG_AUTOSTART=0` or stops what it started. Once the temporary
directory is gone, nobody can reach that service again.

These helpers find and stop the services whose state root lies under a given
directory, so a test can assert that it leaves none. They read the process
table with `ps` and match the command line, so they work on POSIX only; on
other platforms they report nothing.
