"""A session's Run lease (`tool-observations.lock`) as the person at the terminal meets it.

  - The terminal closing (SIGHUP) or a `kill` (SIGTERM) during a Run stops the
    Run as Esc would: the journal gets its terminal record, the lease goes
    away, and the process exits.
  - A process killed mid-Run (SIGKILL) leaves its Run open and its lease
    behind. Resuming the session closes that Run as abandoned, says so, and
    runs the new turn. The same holds for the empty marker an older metacodes
    leaves, once no process has it open.
  - While another process holds the lease, a turn is refused with that
    process's pid, and the REPL stays up.
