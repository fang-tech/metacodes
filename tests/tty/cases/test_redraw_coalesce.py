"""#328: generation redraws go through a ~16 ms merge window.

Event -> UiState dispatch stays synchronous; only the paint is scheduled. A
request with nothing painted in the last window paints at once; requests
inside the window share one frame at its end, drawing the state as it is then.
Submit, tool completion, interrupt and the phase/overlay boundaries paint at
once. These cases drive the real binary through busy streams from the local
slow mock server and check what the merge window must not break: every line
arrives, in order; the spinner keeps moving; typed keys all echo; a resize
leaves one box; an interrupt and an exit right after a stream are clean; a
WebSearch result line is painted before its card goes. Frame counts are only
asserted on POSIX: ConPTY re-encodes the stream, so its bytes are not ours.
