"""Idle prompt key state machine, aligned with Claude Code 2.1.278.

Recorded on the real CLI (ui_compare/cc2.1.278 in the workspace repo) and
matched here:
  - Ctrl+C: the first press shows `Press Ctrl-C again to exit` in the footer
    (and discards a draft); a second press within 800 ms exits. Nothing is
    written to the scrollback, and the hint expires.
  - Ctrl+D: the same double press on an empty prompt; with a draft it deletes
    the character under the cursor.
  - Esc: the first press shows `Esc again to clear` above the box and keeps
    the draft; a second press within 800 ms clears it into history. With the
    `/` menu open, Esc closes the menu and keeps the draft.
  - Enter on a blank prompt does nothing.
