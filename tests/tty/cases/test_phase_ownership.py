"""#330: the turn phase owns every widget it opens.

A reply and the read after it share one fixed region. Before #298 an agent list
left open by a reply swallowed the next prompt's typing; #298 reset a list of
fields at every boundary, and #330 moved that state into the phase's payload,
which a phase change replaces wholesale. These cases drive the real binary
through the reply -> read boundary with widgets open and assert the next prompt
starts clean. Offline: the reply comes from the local slow mock server.
