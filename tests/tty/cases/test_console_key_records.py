"""Keys as a Windows console sends them with win32-input-mode on (#386).

The REPL turns win32-input-mode on so that Shift+Enter is not Enter. From then
on the console sends every key as a record `CSI Vk;Sc;Uc;Kd;Cs;Rc _`, key-ups
and modifier keys included, and every reader of the console input must read
the keys the records stand for, not the records: the permission dialog, the
question dialog and vim's normal mode each read keys outside the prompt's own
key parser. These cases press keys as records on Windows (the pseudo console
takes records written to it, as Windows Terminal sends them) and as the VT
bytes the same keys send everywhere else, and expect the same outcome.

`key:` and `type:` events would not do on Windows: ConPTY hands bytes a
terminal writes in one go to the program as those bytes, without making
records of them, so they never reach the decoder.
